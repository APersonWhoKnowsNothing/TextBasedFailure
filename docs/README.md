# README
This is a simple text based adventure game. Nothing special. In fact it is probably underwhelming.

## "Cheat Codes"
We have a modest list of cheat codes. I don't know how useful these are, but they where nice for us to have when prototyping something. In fact most of our first versions of x feature is inside here. You can access these by typing them as your username (capitlization is unnessery).

#### Full List
* DEBUG_RUN - Prints several things, and tests the typing function.
* DEBUG_POINTS - Gives you 100 points
* DEBUG_POINTS - Gives you *a lot* of points.
* DEBUG_RAND - Simple test for the RNG.
* DEBUG_ROOM - Tests the map. You type the map inthe next promt.
* DEBUG_FIGHT - Starts a standard battle.
